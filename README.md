#### This is the implementation of Apriori Algorithm in python. The apriori algorithm uncovers hidden structures in categorical data.

#### Assumptions made :
 1. Before running either change the name of yor csv file to check.csv or change "check.csv" in read_csv function to your filename.
 2. The format of your csv file should be the same as demonstrated in the demo csv file attached.
 3. The code outputs the final frequent subsets and takes minimum support as input from  user.
 
#### The check.csv file was used to run the algorithm on demo data.
